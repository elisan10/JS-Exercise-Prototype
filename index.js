        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    TASK 2
      - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.

          + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
          + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
      - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
          + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. Window Binding is where the 'this' keyword attaches to the window or a global object in node because of the scope and the context.
    2. Implicit Binding is where the 'this' keyword will refer to whatever is on the left side of the dot. This is usually used in the scope of an object.
    3. Explicit Binding is where the 'this' keyword will be defined when the call, apply, or bind method is used/invoked.
    4. New Binding is where the 'this' keyword will refer to the new object that is created when new a constructor function is created. 
      So it is used in the context of the new constructor function.
